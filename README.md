# This is the project for my followspot I'm designing for [highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/)!

## Why?

I wanted my GCSE Design and Technology project to be a spotlight, but my DT teacher said no and told me to downsize it to a desk lamp. It got me a good grade, but it's not what I wanted to make, so I'm taking the opportunity to make what I want to make, with an LED bright enough to blind my DT teacher! (/j....) I'm going to take inspiration from my project, as I do like the general hexagonal design of it (see below)
